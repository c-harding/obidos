# Ã“bidos: data model

This package contains code for manipulating the data model, and is shared between the server and
frontends/AIs.

## Development

`yarn` installs packages.

`yarn test` runs the tests.

`yarn check` checks the codes for errors, without changing anything.

`yarn lint` reformats the code, and prints any warnings and errors.

When developing, Visual Studio Code is recommended.
Please ensure you typecheck and lint your code before committing.
This happens automatically on save with Visual Studio Code.
